          Commercial real estate (CRE) is down, and businesses have two ways to
          keep their tenants and stay competitive. This can either optimize
          charges or add extra value to their properties. A way to do both is to
          establish smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning

          As a savvy entrepreneur, you can go even further than most in the CRE
          business by passing the control of your buildings over to artificial
          intelligence. Yes, IoT-based HVAC is smart, but AI-empowered HVAC
          systems are the smartest yet.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          So, if traditional HVAC solutions are based on fixed set-point resets,
          modern IoT-based AI-empowered systems focus on predictive control.
          Let’s see what benefits it brings to CRE businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s imagine one of the users of office buildings, the one that takes
          decisions. So here she is—Jessica, CEO of the Local X company. Local X
          spent the lockdown working remotely. Now, it’s time to return to
          office life. And Jessica is looking for a new space for her team. How
          should she choose among numerous options which are more or less equal
          in terms of space, price, and location?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, Jessica has some recent regulations to follow. So here
          comes the first criterion—safety. A healthy building would feature
          touchless tech, incorporated smart ventilation, and filtration systems
          for better indoor air quality (IAQ) in enclosed spaces.
          <strong
            >Regardless of the office layout (open space, cubicles, glass
            partitions), AI-based HVAC systems control air flows and help make
            the entire space safer.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Jessica has to think about her employees who’ve spent months
          in their home offices. What can attract them back to the office?
          Comfort and flexible schedules!
          <strong
            >The AI technology is capable of quick adjustments to occupancy
            conditions.</strong
          >
          Depending on the number of people in the building, the system turns
          on/off air conditioning, regulates the temperature accordingly,
          modifies other settings, and keeps bills low.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Jessica was lucky to find a 9,000 sq feet office in Tower A:
          posh, modern, and smart. The building is equipped with an AI-based
          HVAC system. The latter has become the key selling point to Jessica,
          and now their 40 employees are moving into the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would
          <strong
            >such a high-class building have a similar price as its less
            advanced competitors</strong
          >? First, predictive maintenance ensured by AI increases the
          building’s lifespan and state. Second, automated HVAC processes
          require less time and fewer workers to maintain Tower A. Third, AI
          algorithms help reduce electricity costs.

        <h2>AI-Based HVAC Control Explained</h2>
        <p>
          What does it take to equip a building with a smart HVAC system? Not
          that much, especially if there’s already a traditional HVAC system in
          place.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The HVAC system receives controllable (temperature, humidity, etc.)
          and uncontrollable (weather condition, occupancy status, etc.) inputs
          from multiple sensors. When it gets dark outside, when the space is
          overcrowded, or when we have our hottest summer on record, the HVAC
          control is the first to know about it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          AI is always awake to take these inputs into account and adjust
          settings. Thanks to it, the HVAC system monitors multiple parameters,
          specifies set points, turns units on/off, and performs a number of
          other actions. All this happens absolutely autonomously, no energy
          efficiency manager is needed. When any environmental parameter
          changes: weather, occupancy, energy consumption, and so on, the HVAC
          control regulates itself right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently we compared
          <a

            ><span>smart AI-based building automation systems</span></a
          >
          (BAS) to a chameleon. Like a lizard, the system adapts itself to the
          changing conditions and regulates the building in every aspect, from
          lighting to security. HVAC is among the key BAS components as it makes
          an interior space comfortable.

        <h2>Traditional and AI-Based HVAC Systems Compared</h2>
        <h3>From Manual to Automated HVAC System Management</h3>
        <h4>Basic Use Case</h4>
        <p>
          HVAC systems allow users to manually adjust temperature, ventilation,
          and other parameters. As a consequence, they achieve the desired
          indoor environmental comfort.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>AI-Based Use Case&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          An HVAC system empowered with AI technologies is able to adapt itself
          to changing circumstances. An AI-based solution processes real-time
          data from sensors and
          <strong>adjusts the system automatically, not manually.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a brief recap of how such a system learns to adapt itself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1">
            The system analyzes occupant behavior and comes up with more
            accurate demand predictions.
          </li>
          <li aria-level="1">
            Distributed AI in the end-control devices generates optimal set
            points. Hardware parts stick to these set points. This ensures a
            more dynamic reaction to indoor and outdoor changes.
          </li>
          <li aria-level="1">
            The system uses non-linear HVAC control techniques instead of a
            rule-based approach. Non-linear control allows HVAC to process
            complex data from various sensors. This makes the system’s operation
            closer to the one managed by a human.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1">
            <strong>Quick responsiveness</strong>. No matter how fast your
            occupants’ requirements change, the system reacts quickly without
            manual configuration.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li aria-level="1">
            <strong>Better tariff management</strong>. An intelligent HVAC
            system provides means to reduce bills and optimize energy use, from
            occupancy-based air quality control to eliminating excessive heating
            and cooling.
          </li>
          <li aria-level="1">
            <strong style="letter-spacing: -0.01em">Legal compliance</strong
            ><span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em"
              >. A connected AI-assisted solution makes it easier to follow
              federal and state requirements. This helps avoid unnecessary
              fines.</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em"
            >From Hardware Settings to AI Control</span
          >
        </h3>
        <h4>Basic Use Case</h4>
        <p>
          Traditional ready-to-use HVAC systems work with a preset number of
          parameters. If you have a standard commercial building, you would go
          for a more basic control. Should you decide to integrate HVAC into a
          healthcare institution, you would turn to a more advanced solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems occur when a traditional HVAC system, used in a commercial
          building, needs a serious upgrade. Should your occupants’ criteria
          change or another law be adopted, you may face having to replace the
          current solution with a new one that is more configurable. This would
          definitely result in high upfront investments and additional
          discomfort.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>AI-Based Use Case</h4>
        <p>
          The power of Artificial Intelligence is not the sensors used or the
          platform operated behind them.
          <strong
            >True power lies in algorithms and their possibility to
            learn</strong
          >
          depending on the presented data sets.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have an additional factor to control, HVAC system software
          developers add a number of new data sets. For example, a new legal
          order compels you now to measure and control pollution levels indoors.
          Or your tenant is interested in air quality metrics because their
          employees suffer from asthma or other diseases.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          AI enables you
          <strong
            >to set and adjust new parameters in a more sophisticated
            way</strong
          >. You can upgrade the system’s logic while keeping its hardware part
          in place without massive changes and extra costs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1">
            <strong>Additional control</strong>. Depending on the new purposes
            of your building, a smart HVAC system can be quickly reprogrammed.
          </li>
          <li aria-level="1">
            <strong style="letter-spacing: -0.01em">No big investments</strong
            ><span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em"

        <h3>From Reactive to Predictive Maintenance</h3>
        <h4>Basic Use Case&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          A traditional HVAC system responds to system outages after a failure
          occurs. It uses ready-to-use protocols and reactive maintenance
          strategies.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>AI-Based Use Case</h4>
        <p>
          AI tools help <strong>take immediate control</strong> over your HVAC
          system the moment something goes wrong. This is what John Wallace,
          Director of Innovation, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions,
          thinks about
